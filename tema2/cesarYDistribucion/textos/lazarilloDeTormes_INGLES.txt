Well, know Your Grace, before all things, that they call me Lázaro de Tormes, son of Tomé González and Antona Pérez, natives of Tejares, a village of Salamanca. My birth was within the river Tormes, for which reason I took the nickname; And it was in this way: my father, God forgive, was in charge of providing a mill for a watermelon that is on the banks of that river, in which he was a miller for more than fifteen years; and my mother being one night in the water, pregnant with me, she gave birth to her and gave birth to me there. So I can truly say born in the river.
Well, as I was an eight-year-old boy, they blamed my father for certain bad bloodletting on the sacks of those who came there to grind, for which he was arrested, and confessed and did not deny, and suffered persecution for justice. I hope in God that he is in glory, for the Gospel calls you blessed. At this time, a certain army was made against the Moors, among whom was my father (who was exiled at the time due to the aforementioned disaster), in charge of the military of a gentleman who went there. And with his lord, as a loyal servant, his life died.
My widow mother, as without a husband and without a coat, determined to get close to the good ones because she was one of them, and she came to live in the city and rented a booth and went to cook food for certain students, and washed clothes at certain grooms of the Commander of La Magdalena, so that he was frequenting the stables.
